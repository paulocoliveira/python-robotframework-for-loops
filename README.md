## :question: What is this Repository about?

- This repo contains example code of **How to use for loops in Robot Framework**, including an automated test case using Selenium on LambdaTest Cloud platform.
- This project uses Robot Framework to run the tests.

## :question: More about screenshots...
The potential of 'For Loops' isnâ€™t confined to mere iteration over lists or numbers. Their real strength lies in sculpting test cases that can dynamically adjust to varying inputs, enhancing efficiency and coverage. Whether it's data-driven tests, iterative validation of web elements, or even sophisticated suite setup and teardown processes, 'For Loops' invariably find their place in the heart of efficient automation scripts.

## Running the Code

To run any of the Python scripts from command line use the following command in the correct folder:
```bash
python for-loop.py
```

To run any of the Robot scripts from command line use the following command in the correct folder:
```bash
robot basic_loop.robot
```

## Running the Cloud Grid Sample

By default, the test would be running on LambdaTest Platform on Chrome, and on Windows 11.

As a prerequisite for this code, you need:
1. Download and Install Python

2. Download and Install Visual Studio Code

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code

4. Enter in the cloud-grid folder
```bash
cd cloud-grid
```

5. Install Robot Framework, and Robot Framework Selenium libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to run this cloud grid sample, please run the command below in the project folder:
```bash
robot form_interaction.robot
```
